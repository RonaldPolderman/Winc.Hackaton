        <h3>The gym i no longer train</h3>
        <p>
            During the pandemic Boogieland had the great idea to put heavy bags around the city so people could keep
            training outside. Obviously a great alternative since all gym's where closed and it was prohibited to train
            in group form.<br>
            Because of this great brainchild of Boogieland, the closing of Pancration and the end of the 1st lockdown at
            that time i gave Boogieland a chance and started training there. <br>
            The two people i encountered the most for trainings where Maartje Piersma and Emma Schouwenaar. Neither of
            them seem to have a wikipedia page so for any fans of either of them, there's your chance<br>
            Both of them are great ladies with a solid knowledge about kickboxing altho, probably because of the mostly
            students without any experiences in martial arts the classes consist mostly of stamina exersices and basic
            combinations.<br>
            Nothing wrong with stamina and basic combinations but overall it wasn't my cup of tea.<br>
            The second lockdown hit us and everything closed again. When the second lockdown ended Pancration reopend
            her doors so back to Pancration it was for me.
