        <h3>The gym i currently train most often</h3>
        <p>
            The gym i currently train the most days of the week. Usually around 4 to 6 times a week depending how my
            knee holds up or the time i have.<br>
            There are 3 trainers during a normal week depending on what day of the week and if they have fighter
            obligations.<br>
            Paul Lamoth, Alex Chadud da Silva, Vahid Shahbazi each of them with their own specialty. Where Paul is a
            combination of techniques and stamina Alex leans more to the stamina side of things without losing sight of
            techniques.
            Vahid is the youngest of the three. His muay thai background and him living, fighting and traing for years
            in Thailand shows in his approach. He leans heavily towards techniques and the exact execution of them.<br>
