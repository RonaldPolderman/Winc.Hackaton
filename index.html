            <h2> The journey is about to start</h2>
            <p>
                Around the age of 40 i had a serious appendix operation and was hospitalised for around 3 weeks.
                <br>
                A great reason to stop smoking because, well, i couldn't cause i was bed ridden. So far so good you
                might
                say but i started gaining weight like crazy.<br>
                The peak of my weight was around 220 pounds / 100kg and the people close to me had to take a bycicle
                to
                get
                around
                me.<br>
            </p>
            <h2> The journey of a 1000 miles starts with the first step.</h2>
            <p>
                At 47 enough was enough and a close co-worker and i started intermittent fasting. It's more a
                lifestyle
                then
                it is a diet altho eating and drinking healthy along with the intermittent fasting doesn't slow the
                process
                of losing weight obviously.<br>
                There are different ways to <abbr title="intermittent fasting"> IF</abbr> but we followed the 16-8
                pattern.
                This means as much as dont eat 16 hours and
                then in the next 8 hours you eat normal portions so don't overeat.<br>
                My regular consumption was something along the lines of:<br>
            <ol>
                <li>Breakfast: fruit
                    <ul>
                        <li>banana</li>
                        <li>apple</li>
                        <li>orange</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Dinner: preferably a filler with as less (or slower) carbohydrates as possible stuff like:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Quinoa</li>
                    <li>Sweet potato</li>
                    <li>Bulgur rice</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    An evening snack usually 1 or 2 crackers with some lean topping.
                </li>
            </ol>
            I tried as much as possible to avoid bread, potatoes, pasta's and rice. The problem is however that it
            ain't
            that hard to know what not to eat but to keep things interesting and with some degree of variation is
            harder.

                From the start of IF till 2 years in i pretty much drank nothing but
                water. Obviously cut out any additional
                sugars because ... yeah.... they are great for your lazy brain but bad for your health ( don't get
                me
                wrong
                i love sugars and candy but that don't make em any better for your health)</p>

            <h2>Success is a journey <em>not</em> a destination.</h2>
            Alongside the dabble into IF i always had an interest in martial arts.
            Kickboxing and Muay Thai in particular.<br>
            About a 3 minute walk away there was a gym who teached kickboxing. Pancration, the name of the school,
            was
            founded by Chris Dolman and Thom Harinck. Both well known legends in the sport.
            <aside class="aside1"> More about Chris and Thom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Dolman"
                    title="Chris Dolman Wiki page" target="_blank">here</a> and <a

                    target="_blank">here</a>.
            </aside>
            One of the sensei was the famous champion maker Lucien Carbin along with two other trainers Sergio and
            Cedric.<br>
            This is one of my favorite video's of Lucien Carbin with one of his pupils at Pancration <a

                Carbin
                and Pricilla</a>. To take confusion away, Pricilla is the one with hair.<br>
            And for more data about Lucien <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucien_Carbin"
                title="Lucien Carbin Wiki page" target="_blank">this</a> is his wikipedia page.
            I started training once a week, just some bag work with the beginner class sensei Cedric. My stamina
            level
            was
            horrible and i could barely finish an hour. Even tho i was exhausted at the end of the class i really
            did
            enjoy
            the intensity of the workout.<br>
            about 6 months in the game got me hooked, i started going to the heavy bag trainings 3 times a week and
            felt
            i was getting more confident with throwing my hands and feet.<br>
            Besides my confident level rising my bodyfat level was plummeting. This was the sign for me to go all
            out,
            the sport was addictive, i went from 3 to 4 to 5 to as much as i possibly could go. Sometimes twice a
            day.<br>
            I'm hooked in a possitive way to the sport now. I went to Thailand to train for a few weeks in 2020 just
            before
            all hell broke loose with Covid.
            Due to some unfortunate stuff Pancration had to close it's doors at the original location and is moving
            around
            since.<br>
            Even tho i'm still training at Pancration i tried some other gyms too.
