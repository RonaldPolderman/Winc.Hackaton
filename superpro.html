        <h3>My vacation adventure</h3>
        <p>
            After approximately three years of Pancration training i decided it was time to follow a childhood dream and
            go to Thailand for almost four weeks to go and train Muay Thai.<br>
            Superpro Samui had connections with Pancration so the choise was made. I went early 2020 to get myself
            killed with the old disciplines in the ways of Muay Thai. After a 20 hour flight the humidity hit me like a
            brick wall. I loved it.<br>
            The next day my first heavybag training at Superpro commenced at 7 am. After walking down the stairs before
            the training even started i was sweating like a mule that tries to keep up with an arabian full blood horse.
            <br>
            After warming up with some running, jumping and skip roping the lessons began. They where divided into some
            thai padwork, heavybag and some one on one techniques.
        </p>

            There was, compared to the gyms i trained at thus far in Dutchieland, a great variaty of Kru. Usually there
            where 8 to 10 different kru present for each training session.
            A couple of the ones i remember most are:
