        <h3>My first (gym) love</h3>
        <p>
            My first and long lived gym. I'm still training there ever so often. Usually twice a week. They don't have a
            good location yet so they are training out of some school locations. <br>
            Not the most ideal situations for people like me with some minor knee problems.<br>
            Other then that the trainings, mostly pad work combined with some techniques, are still great. <br>
            These days sensei Cedric gives all of the lessons.
            You can find the Pancration webpage <a href="https://www.pancration.nl/" title="Pancration gym"
                target="_blank">here</a>.
